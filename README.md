# indian-food-allergy-tester

Indian food, one of the most complex cuisines to make, is just as complex to identify. Especially for those with allergies, Indian food can pose dangerous risks at parties, festivals, and gatherings where food is passed around and ingredients are not listed. This project aims to tackle this issue by creating an app that can return a list of possible allergens in Indian food based on an image the user provides. The image will be passed through a model that has been trained on similar images, and once it has identified the food, it will get the recipe and return the list of allergens that will affect the user specifically.
